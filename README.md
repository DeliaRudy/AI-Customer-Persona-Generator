# AI-Customer-Persona-Generator
This Java application leverages Google Cloud's Vertex AI to create in-depth customer personas. By analyzing a business's data from the Google Analytics Data API, it generates three unique personas, each with a mini-description, a fictional story of their pain points, and a data-driven strategy for engagement.

The application is designed for scalability and is ready to be deployed on Google Cloud Run, making it a powerful and flexible tool for any business looking to understand their customers better.
